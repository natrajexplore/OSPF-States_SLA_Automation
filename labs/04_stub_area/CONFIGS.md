# 04_stub_area: all device configurations

STUB AREA, a default route instead of the full table

Everything below is generated from `inventory.yaml`, `baseline/*.cfg`, and `scenarios/` + `templates/` of this lab by
`python scripts/make-lab-configs.py`. Do not edit it by hand. The topology, the use case and the expected output are in `README.md`.

## How to use it by hand

1. Import and start the lab (`labs/labtool.sh 04_stub_area import` and `start`, or import `04_stub_area.zip` in the EVE web UI and start all nodes).
2. Open each router's console. A fresh router asks `Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:`. Answer `no`, press Enter, then type `enable`.
3. Type `configure terminal` and paste that router's block below, then `end` and `write memory`.
4. Routers can be pasted in any order. Adjacencies come up as soon as both ends of a link are configured (about 40 s on the broadcast segment, the OSPF wait timer).

**Management lines.** Every block contains a small management section (`ip vrf MGMT`, `FastEthernet0/0` in that VRF, `ip route vrf MGMT`, `username lab`, `enable secret`, `line vty`). It lets the dashboard and `labtool.sh` log in over SSH and is not part of the OSPF design. For a hand-built lab you can leave it out and use only the console. To use SSH you also need `crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024` once per router (`scripts/bootstrap.py` does that).

**`no ...` lines in the baselines.** The baselines are also used to *reset* a router, so they contain `no` lines (for example `no area 1 stub`) that remove whatever a scenario may have left. On a blank router they are harmless.

## Scenarios (the change the lab is about)

### Scenario `04_stub_area`: STUB AREA - area 1 becomes stub and the ABR injects a default route

All routers of area 1 (R2 and R3 the ABRs, and R4) are configured `area 1 stub`. The adjacency bounces because the stub flag is negotiated in hellos, then R3 floods a default summary LSA into the area and R4 installs `O*IA 0.0.0.0/0`. Rollback removes the stub flag and the default route disappears. (Combine with scenario 05: while area 1 is stub, R4 no longer sees the external E2 route.)

Push to: **R2, R3, R4**, in configuration mode.

**Apply**

```
router ospf 1
 area 1 stub
```

**Check the result** (after about 60 s):

- `R4# show ip route ospf` must match `O\*IA\s+0\.0\.0\.0/0`
- `R3# show ip ospf neighbor` must match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`

**Roll back**

```
router ospf 1
 no area 1 stub
```

**Check the rollback** (after about 60 s):

- `R4# show ip route ospf` must **not** match `O\*IA\s+0\.0\.0\.0/0`
- `R3# show ip ospf neighbor` must match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`

### Scenario `12_partial_stub_rollout`: PARTIAL STUB ROLLOUT - only R3 configured 'area 1 stub' breaks R3-R4 while R2-R4 stays up

Same `area 1 stub` command as scenario 04, but applied to R3 only - not R2 and R4 together. R3's stub flag no longer matches R4's (still non-stub) on their shared area-1 link, so that one adjacency drops while R2-R4 (also area 1, but a completely separate physical link) stays FULL the whole time. This is the real-world danger of staged/partial area-type changes during a maintenance window: the network doesn't go fully down, it degrades asymmetrically, which is much harder to correlate to the change that caused it. Rollback removes the stub flag from R3 alone.

Push to: **R3**, in configuration mode.

**Apply**

```
router ospf 1
 area 1 stub
```

**Check the result** (after about 40 s):

- `R3# show ip ospf neighbor` must **not** match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`
- `R2# show ip ospf neighbor` must match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`

**Roll back**

```
router ospf 1
 no area 1 stub
```

**Check the rollback** (after about 40 s):

- `R3# show ip ospf neighbor` must match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`
- `R2# show ip ospf neighbor` must match `10\.255\.0\.4\s+\d+\s+FULL`

## Commands used by `labtool.sh capture`

```
R4# show ip route ospf
R3# show ip ospf neighbor
R2# show ip ospf neighbor
```
